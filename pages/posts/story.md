# how to tell good stories?

## wondering about storytelling

i was always used to wonder on how to tell good stories. when i started my #buildinpublic journey on twitter, i was always used to think how these people come up with such good stories to tell. i was used to overthink about how to come up with such good stories. but here’s the thing:

> i was not doing enough work at that time. yes, you read it right. i wasn’t doing enough work. i was just lost in the overthinking loop.

## taking action and making progress

but when i started doing it, i mean when i really started building in public, i made my first internet money. i got real clients to work with & deal with. i got real users, real customers, real friends who had so much to teach me and suggest things to me. from that, slowly i started getting real experiences. real stories started to come up & with that i started getting traction as well.

## key insights

here's what i have learned: **stories are not meant to be told first. stories don't mean anything in the #buildinpublic journey if they don't come from experiences.** one more thing i learned is "feedbacks." posting feedbacks of other people, improving the app according to those suggestions & relaunching it asap also creates a good story & image of yourself as a brand.

## join me on the journey

as i continue on this build in public journey, i would also want you to join me in this as well. i would love to be your friend, get your feedback, suggestions and all the things that you have to say to me. please join me here: [@kathanmehtaa](https://twitter.com/kathanmehtaa)
